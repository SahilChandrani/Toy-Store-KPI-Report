## 🧸 Toy Store KPI Dashboard

**Guided Power BI Project – Maven Analytics**

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales and inventory data from a fictional toy store chain in Mexico. This project focuses on uncovering profit-driving categories, store-level performance, and inventory patterns using calculated measures, relationships, and clean visual storytelling.

## 🧭 Objectives
- Connect and profile raw data from multiple CSV files (`Sales`, `Products`, `Stores`, `Calendar`)
- Clean and model data into a star schema
- Create calculated columns and DAX measures for KPIs like Revenue and Profit
- Build a date hierarchy and define relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Design an interactive dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and charts to uncover sales trends and inventory insights
